1. refetchOnMount key is used to check if the query will get called when the component is mounted.This is the traditional way.

2. But we can set refetchOnMount to false which will not call the query when component is mounted.

3. This can be useful in cases where we want to fetch the query after some mutation or set a boolean flag to control api calls.

4. Default value :"true"

```
const results = useQuery(
    "super-heroes",
    () => {
      return axios.get("http://localhost:4000/superheroes");
    },
    {
      staleTime: 30000,
      refetchOnMount: true,
    }
  );
```

refetchOnWindowFocus

Let's say a data has changed in the backend and user has loaded the data using the query.
Now the only way user can get the new data will be when component is mounted again.

But with refetchOnWindowFocus set to true, any time the current tab loses focus and gain
focus again , a fetch query will be called.

```
 const results = useQuery(
    "super-heroes",
    () => {
      return axios.get("http://localhost:4000/superheroes");
    },
    {
      staleTime: 30000,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
    }
  );

```

Default value :"true"
refetchOnWindowFocus:"always"
"always" means the data will be feched irrespective of the query state.
