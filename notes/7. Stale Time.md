Stale time is used when we know that the data will not change for a particular period of time.
We can set this value in the 3rd parameter object.

```
const results = useQuery(
    "super-heroes",
    () => {
      return axios.get("http://localhost:4000/superheroes");
    },
    {
      staleTime: 30000,
    }
  );
```

Query will be in "fresh" state for 30s. After 30s query will be in "stale" state.
Defaule stale time is 0s. So everytime a component mounts, we send a query to the backend.
