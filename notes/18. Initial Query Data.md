Let's say we have a list of users and clicking on single user will move us to another route and fetch the single user details there.
Now that would cause a loading state. We don't want that.
What we want is to not show the loading state instead show whatever few details we have of the user from the list of users query and do a background refetch for the single user query.

For that we have another hook called useQueryClient

```
import { useQuery, useQueryClient } from "react-query";
import axios from "axios";

const fetchSuperHero = ({ queryKey }) => {
  const heroId = queryKey[1];

  return axios.get(`http://localhost:4000/superheroes/${heroId}`);
};
export const useSuperHeroData = (heroId) => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient(); // we call this to get hold of the client instance
  return useQuery(["super-hero", heroId], () => fetchSuperHero(heroId), {
    initialData: () => {
      const hero = queryClient
        .getQueryData("super-heroes")
        ?.data?.find((hero) => hero.id === parseInt(heroId));
      if (hero) {
        return {
          data: hero, // this object structure is important. As this is how we access the data
        };
      } else {
        return undefined; // if undefined return the useSuperHeroData get's called the normal way with loading state and stuff
      }
    },
    // if super-heroes data is present is cache data with identifier "super-heroes" then give
    // me the data of the hero whose id is same as pass superhero heroId
    // Then set this value as initial data.
    // I think getQueryData is use to get data from query cache.
    // We use optional chaining b.c cache might be empty

    //So, when we call useSuperHeroData function , if we already have initial data set to some value then we show the data and start background fetching .
    // If not then we use the loading state
  });
};
```

This way we don't have to use loading indicator
