useQuery will will be used to fetch all the data. GET request

```
useQuery("super-heroes", () => {});
```

1st paremeter is the query key to uniquely identify the query
2nd parameter is a callback function which returns a promise and makes the api call

```
const results = useQuery("super-heroes", () => {
    return axios.get("http://localhost:4000/superheroes");
  });

```

results gives you the data, isLoading and other props

We don't have to manage state while fetching data
