Let's say we want to use the same query in different component.
For that we have to duplicate of the code and write the same code there again.

```
import axios from "axios";
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

export const useSuperHeroesData = (onSuccess, onError) => {
  return useQuery(
    "super-heroes",
    () => {
      return axios.get("http://localhost:4000/superheroes");
    },
    {
      onSuccess: onSuccess,
      onError: onError,
      select: (data) => {
        const superHeroNames = data.data.map((hero) => hero.name);
        return superHeroNames;
      },
    }
  );
};

```

super-heroes query can be called with one single line of code now.
