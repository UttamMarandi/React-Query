Optimistic mutation represents the pattern of updating the state before any mutation assuming
that nothing will go wrong.

Advantage : User will feel no lag due to mutation
Disadvantage : Mutation may not be successful

For optimistic update we have to handle three callback functions

1. onMutate => It is called before the mutation is fired and receives the same data as mutate() function. We update the list even before making the post request.
2. onSettled => This mutation is called on both cases. Mutation fail or mutation success
3. onError => It is called if the mutation encounters an error. The 1st parameter is the error object. 2nd is the value that is mutate() function. 3rd parameter is the context which contains the passed previousData which onMutate return if the mutation fails. This is a coding pattern and not provided in-built.

Full Code

```
import axios from "axios";
import { useMutation, useQuery, useQueryClient } from "react-query";

// Optimistic update

export const useAddSuperHeroDataWithOptimism = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient(); // get the instance of the query client
  return useMutation(addSuperHero, {
    onMutate: async (newHero) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries("super-heroes"); // first thing we need to do is to cancel
      // any query for "super-heroes" so that it don't affect our optimistic approach.
      // This is an async process

      // then we need to get hold of the current query data so that we can rollback if
      // mutation fails
      const previousHeroData = queryClient.getQueryData("super-heroes");

      // then we need to set the data

      queryClient.setQueryData("super-heroes", (oldQueryData) => {
        return {
          ...oldQueryData,
          data: [
            ...oldQueryData.data,
            {
              id: oldQueryData?.data?.length + 1,
              //  we are destructuring because we don't have the id for new user input and setting the id based on length.
              ...newHero,
            },
          ],
        };
      });

      // we do this because if the mutation errors out than we are rolling back to old data.
      return {
        previousHeroData,
      };
    },

    // This function is called if the mutation encounters an error
    onError: (error, hero, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData("super-heroes", context.previousHeroData);
    },

    // This mutation is called on both cases. Mutation fail or mutation success

    onSettled: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries("super-heroes");
      // Here we are fetching the super-heroes data.

      // All the above jargon is done so that user doesn't notice any loading state.
      // This is an overkill for most purposes.
      // I like the client side response handling or just directly invalidate it.
    },
  });
};
