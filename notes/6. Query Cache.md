React query caches every queries for 5 mins.

If a query has been called earlier, than in subsequent component mount react query will
not send requests.

But react query may fetch data in the background in case if backend data has changed.
For that we have the isFetched flag similar to isLoading flag.

So, let's say the list has been changes in db.
At first we will show the cached list and then after some time we will show updated ui.
