Let's say our list got updated after applying certain mutation. After that we have to
manually refetch the data to show the latest list in ui.

In order to automatically call the refetch query after mutation we need to invalidate the query.

We need to use useQueryClient to get an instance of the queryClient.
useMutation takes a 2nd parameter which is an object which contains the onSuccess property.
onSuccess callback takes the function that runs after the success of the mutation

Within this callback we use the queryClient.invalidateQueries and pass in the identifier for
the query which we want to call after the mutation.

```

export const useAddSuperHeroData = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient(); // get the instance of the query client
  return useMutation(addSuperHero, {
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries("super-heroes");
    },
  });
};


```

This will refetch the "super-heroes" query

Full Code

```
import axios from "axios";
import { useMutation, useQuery, useQueryClient } from "react-query";

export const useSuperHeroesData = (onSuccess, onError) => {
  return useQuery(
    "super-heroes",
    () => {
      return axios.get("http://localhost:4000/superheroes");
    },
    {
      onSuccess: onSuccess,
      onError: onError,
      //   select: (data) => {
      //     const superHeroNames = data.data.map((hero) => hero.name);
      //     return superHeroNames;
      //   },
    }
  );
};

const addSuperHero = (hero) => {
  // hero is passed by default. This "hero" is the same object as passes to the mutate method while consuming the mutation
  return axios.post("http://localhost:4000/superheroes", hero);
};

export const useAddSuperHeroData = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient(); // get the instance of the query client
  return useMutation(addSuperHero, {
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries("super-heroes");
    },
  });
};

```
